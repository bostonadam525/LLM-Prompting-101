# Successful AI Adoption Strategies
* How do you ensure the AI product you are building is adopted and becomes a seamless part of the workflow of the user?


## Define AI Objectives
1. Customized Content --> engage the user!
2. Protect user privacy --> ensure trust!
3. Continuous refinement
   * Don't just release the product and move on. Continue to refine and enhance the product to make it better and more usable.
  

## Successful AI 
* Start with Design Thinking
1. Business Objectives
   * Cost reduction
   * Process optimization
   * Customer experience enhancement
2. Opportunity
   * Market intelligence
   * Industry trends
   * Consider what you are developing and how it aligns with the competitive landscape.
3. User Centricity
   * Privacy
   * Ethical guidelines
  
* After design thinking you can move on to "DVF Framework"
  * The "sweet spot" is being in between all of these. 
  1. Desirability
  2. Viability --> use data to make informed decisions about what users are doing and what they want from the AI applications.
  3. Feasability

    4. Data Analytics


## Vision to Execution
1. High Quality Data
2. Data Governance
3. Design Thinking & User Centric Research
4. Obtain user feedback consistenty before general deployment --- does your solution work? do users like it? do we need to fix anything?
5. Foster collaborative ideation with multiple diverse stakeholders
6. Develop a detailed roadmap --> don't "develop as you go" or things may crash and burn
7. Design specific KPIs to track as the product is released and used --> what defines sucess?
8. Implement a robust monitoring system --> be able to robustly track and evaluate your product in production
9. Create a continuous feedback loop
10. Implement small scale pilot programs
11. Prepare for setbacks and challenges
    * Analyze algorithms whether they are doing what they should
    * Diverse data sources and how to work with them
