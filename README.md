# LLM-Prompting-101
A repo for "everything prompting" related to LLMs

## We will add some example code snippets in this repo


## When prompting an LLM, some things to think about:
* Are the prompts structured appropriately?
* Are you following "prompting best practices"?
* Consider whether you need to utilize specific prompting techniques for your specific use case(s).
* There is a very detailed repo that already exists with specific prompting techniques: [Prompt Engineering Guide Repo](https://github.com/dair-ai/Prompt-Engineering-Guide?tab=readme-ov-file)

## General Prompting Techniques
1. Zero shot
2. one-shot
3. few-shot
4. multi-step
5. chain of thought 
    * requires LLM to give chain of thought reasoning before providing response which is useful for solving “reasoning” tasks
6. iterative prompting
7. etc….
